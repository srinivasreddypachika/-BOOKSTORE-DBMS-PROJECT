The objective of the project is to build an automated database in the place of current manual entry system to better keep track of its customers, suppliers, order and stock. As bookstore has huge unorganized data and new data adding up every single day it is becoming hard for bookstore management to manage its customers data and keep a track of its supplies, order and inventory.
At present, the book store management system uses MS Excel, all records related to Sales, stock, Orders, Payment and Suppliers are stored in excel files. There is lot of duplicate and recurring data. When the records are changed they need to update each and every excel file. In case of Customer records, all information related to customers and the product which the customer has purchased is to be stored in the Customers excel files. Any changes or updates related to customer like his phone number, address, email etc. are manually updated in the excel.
To manage the whole data, the person maintaining records has to take great pain. Various excel files has to be maintained for each separate process. There is no option to find previous saved records. There is no security; anybody can access any report and sensitive data.
This system is designed to overcome all the above discussed problems of bookstore. This system is designed to record the customer’s purchase history, supplier’s incoming stock, Order history, current stock of books in the bookstore and all other transaction details between customer- bookstore and bookstore-supplier. Thus, this could be an inventory system which helps to keep a track of what you have in your store, informs you when you need to purchase more stock or supplies by category and maintains all customers data which can be used for analyzing the buying trends of customers. However, this project design is limited to maintain customer data base only and not used for analyzing customer buying trends.

This data base management system is designed to overcome data redundancy issues, automate data management and reduce manual effort. This system is designed to easily store, manage, update and retrieve data when needed. This report comprises of proposed bookstore
